# Environmental Impact of Food Production

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the impacts of climate change on global food supply by examining greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and land utilization across various food products. Using data science techniques, we aim to identify high-emission food categories and explore sustainable practices to mitigate environmental effects.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: In-depth exploration of emissions, water usage, and land requirements for different food products.
- **Clustering** : Grouping of food products based on their environmental impacts using K-Means clustering.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementation of a Random Forest Regressor to predict total emissions based on selected environmental factors.
- **Visualizations**: Various charts and graphs to depict findings, including:
  - Bar plots of emissions by food type
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Box plots for water usage

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information on various food products, their emissions, and resource usage. It can be obtained from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
